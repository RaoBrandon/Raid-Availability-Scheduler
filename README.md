# Raid-Availability-Scheduler
This program takes a csv file and finds a schedule that fits the players availability.

This file contains an executable which creates a schedule based on user input as well as an included .csv file containing the information of the availability of different players. 

In the script folder you can find the python script that created the executable file. In order for players to determine what days are good for them to create a team of 6 and schedule a raid in Destiny 2, they can run this program and it does it for them!
